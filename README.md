# odin-recipes

## Monday, August 22, 2022
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. The purpose will be to use the HTML knowledge that I have been acquiring and put it into practice by building a basic recipe website. The website will be quite basic for now, as the focus is HTML and not CSS.
