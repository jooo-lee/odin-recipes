# odin-recipes

## Monday, August 22, 2022
This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. The purpose will be to use the HTML knowledge that I have been relearning and put it into practice by building a basic recipe website. The website will be basic for now, as the focus is HTML and not CSS.

After relearning some very basic CSS, I have added external CSS to practice some of the concepts. Although the website is still very basic and not meant to be a resume or portfolio project, it was a good refresher on HTML and CSS.
